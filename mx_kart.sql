As a result PHP evolves much faster than other commercial languages, and the code is continuously updated with bug fixes, enhancements, and language extensions, which extend its capabilities.\r\n\r\nHand coding allows you to implement the latest PHP developments in your code as soon as they are released. It offers you total freedom to ensure that your web site does exactly what you want it to, and you are not just limited to the built in code generated by your development program.\r\n\r\nCode that you''ve written yourself can also interact with the Dreamweaver MX generated code, so you can create standard code quickly using the Dreamweaver MX server behaviors, and then modify it yourself to perform extra functions.\r\n\r\nWe''re now going to look at the many ways you can create and edit code (both PHP and HTML) in Dreamweaver MX.\r\n\r\n', '2006-07-20 19:04:00'),

The new lens features all-glass construction and two aspherical elements in a seven-element formula.<P>  In order to make the camera smaller, Canon engineered the new PowerShot A510 model to accept SD media. Even with its small size, the camera sports a large 1.8-inch LCD screen for easy preview and review. It also includes Canon''s exclusive DIGIC image processor for faster processing speed and excellent image quality with crisp, vibrant colors.<P>  The PowerShot A510 digital camera requires only two AA batteries, while providing the same number of shots (300 with LCD screen on) as previous models that used four batteries, thanks to reductions in power consumption made possible by improvements in key components and circuit design.<P>  Like its A75 predecessor, the PowerShot A510 digital camera is equipped with a nine-point AiAF "smart" autofocus system and 13 shooting modes. The standard shooting modes are Full Auto, Program, Manual, Shutter-priority, and Aperture-priority with additional modes including Portrait, Landscape, Night Scene, Fast Shutter, Slow Shutter, Special Scene, Stitch Assist, and Movie. The Special Scene mode, which makes it easy for beginners to achieve optimum results in many popular photo opportunities, has been enhanced with the addition of two new settings called Night Snapshot and Kids and Pets. The PowerShot A510 digital camera is also capable of recording movies with sound for up to three minutes per clip, making it perfect for capturing memories in motion.<P>  The new camera''s grip is ergonomically improved, and the control layout is even easier to use than before. Other camera functions including self-timer and review have also been enhanced for greater creative flexibility.<P>  <B>The DIGIC Difference</B><BR>  Image quality is enhanced and improved as a result of Canon''s proprietary DIGIC (Digital Imaging Integrated Circuit) image processor. DIGIC combines the roles of image processing and camera function control into one chip, resulting in faster display and write times for each image and lower power consumption, which extends battery life. Moreover, because DIGIC technology was designed specifically for use in digital cameras it is also capable of handling JPEG compression and expansion, memory card control, LCD/video control and processing gain control (control of CCD signal amplification), autoexposure, autofocus, auto white balance control, and most other functions.<P>  <B>Print/Share Button</B><BR>  Located on the backside of the PowerShot A510 digital camera is the Print/Share button. This button simplifies and accelerates direct printing to compatible Canon and PictBridge-enabled printers and one-touch image transfer to Windows XP, Me, 2000, and 98 computers for use with image processing programs, uploading to the Internet, or as e-mail attachments. When the camera is connected to a compatible printer or computer, the Print/Share button illuminates to let the user know to press the Print/Share button to begin the printing or downloading process.<P>  <B>Optional Accessories</B><BR>  In addition to its rich feature set, the PowerShot A510 digital camera is compatible with a wide variety of optional accessories including supplementary wide-angle (WC-DC52), telephoto (TC-DC52A) and close-up lenses (52mm Close-up Lens 250D). These accessories enhance the new camera''s versatility and make it easier to use in specialized applications such as real estate and insurance photography. A waterproof case WP-DC60 is also available and can be used at depths up to 130 feet.

Combining the outstanding response of Nikon''s patented digital and photographic performance with optical performance available only from renowned Nikkor interchangeable lenses and expanded shooting options only available in a quality digital SLR camera, the Nikon D50 makes exceptional digital SLR photography a reality for everyone.<P>  The next evolution of Nikon''s scene-optimized Digital Vari-Program modes simplifies picture taking, freeing the photographer to concentrate on capturing the evanescence of special moments. Selecting one of the seven easily distinguishable icons from the handy exposure mode dial optimizes otherwise complex settings and ISO-equivalent sensitivity to produce consistently remarkable results. Newly added is Child mode, which makes it easier to take memorable pictures of the little ones complete with ideal vivid color and contrast--ready to print beautifully without the fuss of later adjustments at the computer. Full manual exposure control is also available, allowing more advanced photographers all the creative freedom they desire while also making it possible for all photographers to expand their enjoyment of photography.<P>  The D50 features a new 6.1 effective megapixel Nikon DX Format CCD image sensor and a highly advanced image processing engine that team together to create truly faithful image files that are capable of significant enlargement while remaining manageable in overall file size, making it easier to take and store more great pictures. These optimized components produce more consistent results, even under shooting conditions that challenge other digital cameras, such as when working with light-colored subjects or long exposure shots.<P>  Distinguishing itself over lesser systems, the Nikon D50 is always ready to shoot when that special moment or expression presents itself. When the power is turned on, the camera is ready to shoot in just 0.2 seconds for near-instant readiness. The shutter''s release lag time is also minimized for near-instant response that virtually eliminates a common frustration of digital photography.<P>  <table align="right" width="350" cellpadding="3"><tr><td></td></tr> <tr><td><center><b><i><small>The D50 is capable of continuous shooting at 2.5 frames per second for bursts of up to 137 pictures.</i></b></small></center></td></tr></table>  Continuous shooting at 2.5 frames per second can be maintained for bursts of up to 137 pictures, making action photography a reality. Pictures taken are instantly processed and recorded to the photographer''s compact SD (Secure Digital) memory card. A new USB 2.0 Hi-Speed interface supports faster transfer of images when connected to a compatible computer.<P>  Shutter speed choices extend from 30 seconds to an action-stopping 1/4,000 second. A high-speed flash sync speed up to 1/500 second makes great fill flash photography possible, and Nikon technology makes it automatic. A bulb setting is also included for long exposures. The shutter is designed to ensure fast curtain action for consistent operation and accurate, predictable results, even at high shutter speed settings. Auto ISO maximizes available light by automatically setting ISO-equivalent sensitivity across the available range of 200 to 1600. D50 photographers can also opt to set the ISO sensitivity manually for personal control.<P>  The D50''s 5-area autofocus system inherits Nikon''s proven cross-type center sensor, broad frame coverage, and class-leading low-light detection found only in the award-winning Nikon D70 camera, and it delivers even greater AF precision with fast, more consistent subject acquisition and improved focus tracking. The new system adopts AF-A mode for smooth automated operation that switches between AF-S (single-servo autofocus) and AF-C (continuous-servo autofocus) depending on the movement of the subject in the framed shot. An AF-assist illuminator is also included, which helps maximize performance when shooting in low lighting conditions.<P>  The D50 produces consistently natural coloration by measuring the entire frame of the shot and matching white balance to the light source. Advanced auto white balance handles most lighting situations, but the flexible options include a choice of six specific manual settings, white balance bracketing for added creative choice of results, as well as a preset option for using a gray or white object as a calibrating reference under mixed lighting conditions.<P>  Nikon''s new 3D Color Matrix Metering II ensures accurate exposure control in most types of lighting situations by automatically comparing input from its frame-wide 420-pixel sensor for each scene to a large onboard database of over 30,000 scenes from actual photography. Professionals and amateurs alike rely on Nikon''s exclusive light metering technologies that produce ideal exposures instantly. Newly developed exposure evaluation methods detect highlights and shadows in the frame and compensate for them to help minimize under- or over-exposure by comparing the lighting pattern of the frame with the onboard database of scenes, thus enhancing performance for more accurate and consistent exposures.<P>  The compact, lightweight design of the new D50 makes it easy to carry on any outing, while its body contours and easily accessible controls provide handling efficiency and easy operation. Newly designed on-screen menus present clear and helpful user information in plain language on the D50''s large 2.0-inch LCD monitor, and intuitive help dialogs are available for on-the-spot reference to the respective menu selections.

(6, 1, 'Canon EOS 20D', 'CAN-20D', 1379.94, '<b>From the Manufacturer</b><br /> The perfect EOS for advanced amateurs and professionals alike, the EOS 20D sets new standards in its class. Featuring an all-new 8.2 MP CMOS sensor, a second-generation DIGIC II image processor, 5 fps performance for up to 23 consecutive frames, and a 0.2 second start-up time, the EOS 20D is designed to capture richly detailed, perfectly exposed images with speed formerly found only in cameras several times the price. Other features include a top shutter speed of 1/8,000 seconds, flash sync at 1/250, a new high-precision nine-point AF system, a built-in multicontroller for fast focusing point selection, and a refined magnesium alloy body for rugged, go-anywhere photography. Compatible with not only Canon''s new EF-S lenses but the entire EOS system of lenses and flashes, the EOS 20D is a professionally featured camera with a consumer price tag. <p><b>8.2-Megapixel CMOS Sensor</b><br> Canon''s all-new large-area CMOS (complementary metal oxide semiconductor) sensor captures images with exceptional clarity and tonal range, and offers the most pixels in its class. This second-generation APS-C-size sensor (22.5 by 15.0mm) has the same 3:2 ratio as film cameras, enabling an effective angle of view that is 1.6 times the normal EF lens focal length. The EOS 20D has an extensive ISO range (from 100 to 1600 plus ISO 3200 in extended mode), and the sensor features a newly developed set of narrow-gap microlenses and noise-reduction circuits to improve performance at high ISOs and optimized photodiode configurations for improved performance at all ISOs. This results in larger, clearer, sharper, and more detailed photographs right from the start.  <p><b>Second-Generation DIGIC II Image Processor	</b><br> The EOS 20D benefits from Canon''s in-house development: The DIGIC II image processor was developed originally for the EOS-1D Mark II and enhances every aspect of image capture. Information captured by the CMOS sensor is processed and assembled into images of exceptional quality by this new image processor. With the DIGIC II image processor on board, photographers can expect precise, natural colors and spot-on white balance in any number of lighting situations. Through sophisticated signal processing algorithms, the DIGIC II image processor even accelerates all aspects of image capture, while consuming less energy than other processors.  <p><b>Every Function Optimized for Speedy RAW and JPEG Capture  </b><br> The EOS 20D has been designed to capture images with speeds that had been reserved for professional-level cameras. Whether it''s the 0.2 second start-up time, the high-speed mirror drive, the class-leading 65 microsecond shutter release lag time, or the predictive AF focusing at speeds up to 5 frames per second, the EOS 20D will amaze and delight photographers who don''t want to wait for their camera when they''re ready to shoot. The 20D''s CMOS sensor allows four-channel high-speed data readout, and the DIGIC II image processor processes the data quickly, writing files to the CompactFlash card faster, and allowing continuous shooting for up to 23 frames (JPEG Large/Fine) with significant reductions in buffer clearing times.  <p><b>JPEG or Simultaneous RAW+JPEG  </b><br> Whenever you shoot the EOS 20D, you can choose to have it record RAWs or JPEGs alone, or in RAW plus JPEG formats simultaneously. The JPEG recording format is ideal for purposes such as Internet image transfers that require reduced file sizes. Canon''s proprietary RAW (.CR2) format, on the other hand, employs lossless compression to ensure the highest possible image quality, and is recorded at 12 bits per pixel to provide a wider range of tones and superior detail in bright highlights and deep shadows when compared with JPEG files. RAW files must be processed before they can be opened in your computer''s image-editing software. This conversion process typically takes only a few seconds using the dedicated driver software, which will convert the RAW file into a standard 8-bit-per-channel JPEG or TIFF file, or for maximum tonal range, a 16-bit TIFF. There are six selectable settings for in-camera JPEG image quality, when CF card space is at a premium.  <p><b>Expansive Sensor Array for Easier Composition  </b><br> The EOS 20D has a newly developed high-precision nine-point AF system for speedy and accurate focusing in any situation. An improved focusing screen with precision matte finish enables brighter and easier manual focus. A newly developed multicontroller, conveniently located on the back of the camera for thumb-controlled action, allows the photographer to instantly choose any of the nine focus points or direct the camera to choose them automatically. Focusing points are positioned in the viewfinder in a wide diamond-shaped array, allowing the user to achieve focus quickly in numerous compositions and situations.  <p><b>Features Formerly Offered Only in Canon''s Pro Cameras Allow for More Fine-Tuning  </b><br> Photographers will find their options for color settings greatly expanded in the new EOS 20D. Taken directly from the EOS-1D Mark II, the white-balance compensation function utilizes the new multicontroller and a nifty LCD monitor display to tune any white balance setting up to +/-9 steps in blue, amber, magenta, or green hues to ensure spot-on color. The new white-balance bracketing feature produces a series of three files varying white balance from magenta to green or blue to amber, depending on the lighting situation. <p> Images can be processed directly for the industry print standard Adobe RGB or standard sRGB, and are compatible with DCF 2.0 and Exif 2.21 standards for greater flexibility. A range of in-camera image processing parameters can optimize JPEG files for direct printing or post-processing, or can be customized to the user''s tastes and needs. <p> The EOS 20D also features a built-in monochrome mode, a first in Canon digital SLRs, which uses digital processing to re-create the effects of a number of different black and white filters and toning effects. These features help to take the guesswork out of black-and-white photography, reducing the need for post-processing by delivering the desired detail and contrast of a black-and-white image from the start.  <p><b>Strength and Elegance Combined	</b><br> The EOS 20D feels solid and rugged in your hands, ensuring stable, easy handling. Its rigid chassis combines engineering plastic with stainless steel and is covered by strong, lightweight magnesium alloy panels on the top, front, and rear. Controls are ergonomically shaped and positioned to sustain the EOS tradition of ergonomic excellence and sure-fire operation. The newly designed grip, shutter button, and rubber skin contribute to this excellent holding comfort, and the camera''s high-profile built-in flash is compact and hides itself neatly into the top of the body. A newly refined finish adds to the elegance of the camera body.  <p><b>Expanded Zoom Display During Playback  </b><br> While viewing recorded images on the camera''s 1.8-inch, high-definition TFT color LCD, you can enter enlargement mode and enlarge them up to 10 times in 15 stops for detailed analysis of lighting, composition, camera movement, focusing accuracy, facial expression, and more. The new multicontroller enables horizontal and vertical scrolling, while the main dial enables viewing of the previous or next image stored in the CF card at the same enlarged view. In the maximum reduced view, nine images are displayed simultaneously on the screen, making them quicker to find. The camera can be set to automatically rotate vertical images so they can be viewed easily on the monitor and also after downloading to your computer.  <p><b>Direct Printing with PictBridge-Compatible Printers	 </b><br> The EOS 20D lets you print beautiful photos with minimum time and effort--directly from the camera. Simply connect the camera to any PictBridge-compatible printer via the high-speed USB 2.0 port to print images stored on the CF card. You can even set the EOS 20D to trim the image, add a surrounding "frame," superimpose a date, or print multiple copies. The EOS 20D''s direct-printing feature complies with Exif v2.2 (Exif Print) and DPOF v1.1. With a host of portable and home printers available from Canon, including the new PIXMA iP4000 and PIXMA iP3000 photo printers, getting tangible results from the camera has never been faster or easier.  <p><b>Software  </b><br> The EOS 20D comes bundled with three software CDs: Canon''s Digital Photo Professional 1.1, the EOS Solution Disk 8.0, and Photoshop Elements 2.0. Each application is designed to optimize captured images and streamline the digital workflow.  <p><b>Includes EF-S 18-55mm f3.5-5.6 Lens  </b><br> The EF-S 18-55mm f3.5-5.6 is a standard zoom lens.

Because you want an image made for widescreen, not adapted for widescreen. Widescreen is the future--every HD television is widescreen. <p> The story of how we do it may be a bit technical, but the result is clear to see. Canon camcorders use the entire width of its image sensor to capture your precious video in true 16:9 format. What difference does that make? It''s simple. With more pixels captured, you get better image quality. Other camcorders force the wider picture into a smaller space on the sensor--giving you a less true image, with fewer pixels and lower quality. On a Canon camcorder, the canals of Venice will be as grand as you remembered seeing them.  <p> In addition, the viewfinder on your Optura 600 will display the image in a "letterbox" view--from side to side and top to bottom, what you see will be what you get. No guessing and extra work, looking at an image that''s distorted like a fun house mirror. You can also use the widescreen feature in both Program Mode and Easy Recording Mode and can be used along with the camcorder''s advanced image stabilization.  <p> <b>Optical Performance You Can See</b><br> The Optura 600 comes with a 10x optical zoom lens, precisely matched to the camcorder''s CCD and featuring a unique spectral coating to reduce flare and ghosting.

Thanks to Canon''s superior electronic expertise, the Optura 600''s built-in high-quality image stabilizer allows you to shoot rock-steady video, even when you''re at maximum telephoto without a tripod. It even works while panning and zooming.  <p> <b>Megapixel CCD</b><br> The Optura 600 features a class-leading 4.3-megapixel CCD along with an RGB primary color filter to deliver crisp images with stunning true-to-life color. Other camcorders process color using a standard CMYG filter, resulting in duller colors. Canon''s RGB filter separates light into its red, green, and blue components, resulting in professional-quality images with natural-looking tones and vivid hues. Together, the 4.3-megapixel CCD and RGB color filter deliver uncompromisingly brilliant results.  <p> <b>Digic DV</b><br> Because Canon''s exclusive Digic DV signal processing circuit processes video and still images differently, you get uncompromising image quality for both. Video and still images have different color requirements and Digic DV technology processes the two signals accordingly. That means your video images are maximized for viewing on monitors and for projection. Digic DV is just one of Canon''s DV Photo Plus technologies that help to unleash the performance potential of the Optura 600.  <p> <TABLE ALIGN="left" BORDER=0 CELLSPACING=0 width="275" CELLPADDING=5> <TR ALIGN="center" VALIGN="middle"> <TD> <IMG SRC="http://images.amazon.com/images/G/01/photo/detailpages/b0007d9b9g-canon-zr200-lowlight.jpg" ALT="Night Mode" BORDER=0><br><small><b><i>Night Mode brings out low-light detail other camcorders miss.</i></b></small> </TD> </TR> </TABLE>  <p> <b>Low-Light Performance</b><br> Dinner with friends, evening festivals, late-night excursions--now you can capture them all thanks to Optura 600''s low-light performance. With the Night Mode, the sensitivity of the camera''s CCD is automatically boosted and the shutter speed is lowered to give you better performance in low-light conditions.  <p> In SuperNight mode, your camcorder''s white LED assist lamp lights up whenever light levels fall too low. And, in Night Plus Mode, you can keep the camcorder''s LED lamp on continuously, for shooting under the most demanding conditions.  <p> For the times when even Night Plus Mode isn''t enough, the Optura 600 comes with a built-in Mini Video Light.

Simply use a DV cable to connect the camcorder to your computer''s DV Terminal and you can be sure that your favorite, recorded moments retain their pristine image and sound.  <p> <b>Motion JPEG Mode</b><br> With the Optura 600''s Motion JPEG Mode you can record movie clips directly to the camcorder''s memory card, transfer it to your computer, and e-mail or stream it over the web. When using an SD Memory Card, you can also record for the full length of the card. That''s a 60-minute movie with a 512MB card.

Simply connect your camcorder directly to select Canon printers or any PictBridge-compatible printer with the supplied USB cable. Then, with nothing more than the touch of the Print and Share button, you can print directly from your Optura 600 without going through a computer. (The same button lets you quickly download images to your computer.) And because the camcorder tags each photo you take with information based on Exif 2.2 Print standards, your printer is able to produce more realistic images.

Much like extra-bulky, battery-draining "desktop replacement" notebooks, the VAIO VGN-A290 offers such amenities as a massive 17-inch widescreen display, a huge 100 GB hard drive and both CD and DVD burning. Yet the unit is far more power efficient than most desktop replacements and comparatively compact at just 8.6 lbs. Though it may cost a bit more than a standard notebook, the VAIO VGN-A290 is perfect for those who crave the next generation of portable computing today.<p> <table width="100%" border="1" bordercolor="#FFFFFF">   <tr>     <td width="23%" height="100" align="center" valign="top">       <p><strong><font size="2">Sony Series A Display Sizes</font></strong><p><br>         <font size="2"><strong><em>The VGN-A290 features a 17" screen.</em></strong></font></p>       </td>     <td width="77%" rowspan="2" align="left" valign="top"><p><strong>Processor<br>         </strong>At the heart of any computer lies the CPU (or processor), a massive          collection of miniature transistors that governs the speed and power of          the entire unit. Some of today''s notebooks are equipped with high-end          CPU''s on par with those found in top-of-the-line desktop PCs, while others          are quick enough only for basic duties such as word processing, email          and the like. The VAIO VGN-A250 is equipped with an Intel Pentium M 725          processor operating at 1.6 GHz. This is one of three components that comprise          Intel''s efficient Centrino system (the others being a specialized Intel          chipset and integrated wireless support). Centrino-equipped notebooks          are generally smaller, easier on the batteries, and more versatile than          their non-Centrino counterparts. This particular CPU is part of Intel''s          upgraded Pentium M lineup, featuring an amazing 2 MB of Level 2 cache          for extremely fast access to recently opened data and a fast 400 MHz front          side bus to help reduce data streaming bottlenecks. Though its raw clock          speed is not on par with that of a high-end Intel Pentium or AMD Athlon,          this CPU will easily handle most every mobile task while at the same time          improving battery life. Moreover, Sony has equipped the system with solid          graphics support and adequate memory -- two components vital to overall          performance.</p>       <p><strong>Memory</strong><br>         Computers typically store information on their hard drive, but they keep          frequently and recently accessed data in Random Access Memory (RAM) for          faster retrieval. More RAM means more efficient computing, superior multitasking          and less strain on your hard drive. The VAIO VGN-A290 incorporates a startling          one GB of RAM. This is a massive allotment for a notebook and substantially          more than that of most desktops as well. Thusly, users can expect superb          multitasking and virtually no slowdowns during ultra-complex tasks.<br>       </p></td>   </tr>   <tr>     <td height="150" align="center" valign="top"><br>       <font size="2"><strong><em>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0002XUXBG/002-5874727-5663227">VGN-A250</a>        features a 15.4" screen.</em></strong></font><em></p></em></td>   </tr> </table> <p><strong>Video</strong> <br>   CPU''s are usually so busy doing basic calculations that they need help translating    visual output to the viewing screen. This is the duty of the graphics card (or    graphics controller). This system''s graphics controller is an ATI Mobility Radeon    9200 with 64 MB of dedicated video RAM. Dedicated video memory is far preferable    to &quot;shared&quot; video memory (where the graphics controller appropriates    a portion of the main system memory), and this 64 MB allotment is considered    plenty for 3D graphics, midlevel 3D animation packages and many of the latest    3D games. <table width="100%" border="1" bordercolor="#FFFFFF" bgcolor="#FFFFFF">   <tr bordercolor="#FFFFFF">      <td width="58%" rowspan="2"> <p><b>Display</b><br>         The VAIO VGN-A290 sports a 17-inch WUXGA display. This is a comparatively          enormous screen when compared to other notebook displays, and all the          more spectacular given the unit''s surprisingly compact size and lightweight          mass. It''s highly sophisticated too -- sporting Sony''s new XBRITE Technology          for better contrast and a brighter picture, and an exceedingly detailed          1920 by 1200 maximum resolution. Furthermore, the widescreen format is          perfectly suited to watching the Hollywood blockbusters you''ll play on          the system''s DVD-compatible optical drive.       <p><b>Hard Disk</b><br>         A 100 GB hard drive in a mobile computer many be a rarity, but that didn''t          stop Sony.

A &quot;CD-ROM&quot;    drive allows you to install CD-based applications and play music CDs. A &quot;CD-RW&quot;    drive adds CD &quot;burning&quot;, so you can also backup your important files    to long-lasting discs and create personalized music CDs. With a DVD-ROM drive    you can watch DVD movies. And with a DVD-RW drive, you can &quot;write&quot;    home movies to durable discs and archive files to DVD (DVDs boast more than    seven times the storage capacity of a CD). Some drives allow you to do a combination    of all of these tasks. This system features a DVD+R Double Layer/DVD&plusmn;RW    Drive, through which you can do all of the above. The drive also supports today''s    hot new double layer DVD format that effectively doubles the capacity of typical    DVDs.</p> <p><strong>Keyboard and Controls</strong><br>   You''ll control your notebook via an 82-key keyboard and a standard electro-static    touch pad.</p> <p><strong>Connectivity and Expansion</strong><br>   The VAIO VGN-A290 features a bevy of connectivity facilities, including a 56K    modem for low-speed dial-up Internet and email access, a 10BASE-T/100BASE-TX    Ethernet port for high-speed wired network and Internet, and an integrated Intel    PRO/Wireless 2200BG Network Connection (802.11b/g) for cord-free e-communication    at home, at the office or on the road via a local public hotspot. Other key    amenities include high-speed USB 2.0 ports for plug and play devices such as    external drives and digital cameras, an IEEE 1394 FireWire port (commonly used    for quick data uploads from digital camcorders), and an AV Entertainment Dock    with high-end perks such as a TV Tuner and MPEG Encoder, VGA Monitor port, VHF/UHF    TV port, S-Video in/out, DVI-D, Optical out, Line in (RCA Pin), Line out (RCA    Pin) and more. Suffice to say that no matter what sort of connections you want    to make, you can likely do it with the VAIO VGN-A290.</p> <p><strong>Operating System and Software</strong><br>   Sony will install Microsoft''s Windows XP Home Edition operating system, a variety    of productivity and business applications, and a broad range of digital photo,    audio and video utilities.</p> <p><strong>Dimensions and Weight</strong><br>   Many of today''s most powerful notebooks are also the largest, weighing ten or    twelve lbs or more and therefore too big and cumbersome for extensive, continuous    traveling. These are often referred to as &quot;desktop replacements&quot;.    On the other extreme are &quot;thin and lights&quot; or &quot;ultra-portables&quot;,    super-miniaturized units that are typically less powerful than their larger    brethren but weigh as little as two lbs and will often fit comfortably inside    a large purse. Despite its impressively spacious display and cutting-edge capabilities,    the VAIO VGN-A290 is not excessively heavy at just 8.6 lbs. It is larger than    average at 16 by 11 inches, though not nearly as bulky as most other similarly    equipped portables. <br><br /><br /><b>Product Description:</b><br />The VAIO A290 is the desktop replacement notebook that can perform like an entertainment center.
